My Name is Eric Hines. I am currently an insurance broker and also a day trader with not mcuh experience in the tech field.
A few career goals are to get a complete understanding of the fintech field in order to find a job in this field and possibly becoming a quantitative analyst. I'd also like to use the knowledge of fintech to helping propel my insucance company.
I chose fintech because finance and technology are two rapid growing fields that have the capability of completely changing world landscapes
